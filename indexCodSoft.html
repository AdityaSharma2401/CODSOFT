                <p>The No Guessing Game is a simple, interactive web-based game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game involves the player trying to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Here's a detailed description of how the game works and how it's developed:

                    Game Description
                    Objective: The player needs to guess a number that is randomly chosen by the computer within a specific range (e.g., 1 to 100).
                    User Interface: The game has a user-friendly interface where the player can input their guesses and receive feedback.
                    Feedback: After each guess, the player receives feedback indicating whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
                    Attempts: The game keeps track of the number of attempts the player has made.
                    Winning: The game congratulates the player when they guess the correct number and provides the option to play again..</p>
